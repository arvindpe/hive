Creation of Table in Hive and Loading of data

A]
CREATE DATABASE:
create database petrol;

B] 
create table petrol (distributer_id STRING,distributer_name STRING,amt_IN STRING,amy_OUT STRING,vol_IN INT,vol_OUT INT,year INT) row format delimited fields terminated by ‘,’ stored as textfile;

C]
load data local inpath ‘/home/hduser/Desktop/hive/data/petrol_data.txt’ into table petrol;

d]create table petrol1 (distributer_id STRING,distributer_name STRING,amt_IN INT,amt_OUT INT,vol_IN INT,vol_OUT INT,year INT) row format delimited fields terminated by ',' stored as textfile;


E] insert overwrite table petrol1 select distributer_id,distributer_name,regexp_replace(amt_IN,"\\$",""),regexp_replace(amy_OUT,"\\$",""),vol_IN,vol_OUT,year from petrol;

1)In real life what is the total amount of petrol in volume sold by every distributor?
Ans::---

select distributer_id,distributer_name,sum(vol_out) as total from petrol group by distributer_id,distributer_name;

A0M 0G6	Bharat	691
A0P 2M4	Bharat	662
A0V 7Q3	Bharat	880





2)Which are the top 10 distributors ID’s for selling petrol and also display the amount of petrol sold in volume by them individually?
Ans:----
select distributer_id,distributer_name,sum(vol_out) as total from petrol group by distributer_id,distributer_name order by total desc limit 10;

3)Find real life 10 distributor name who sold petrol in the least amount.
Ans:----
 select distributer_id,distributer_name,sum(vol_out) as total from petrol group by distributer_id,distributer_name order by total limit 10;

4) The constraint to this query is the difference between volumeIN and volumeOuT is illegal in real life if greater than 500. As we see all distributors are receiving patrols on every next cycle.

List all distributors who have this difference, along with the year and the difference which they have in that year.
Hint: (vol_IN-vol_OUT)>500

Ans:-
select distributer_id,distributer_name,year,(vol_in-vol_out) from petrol where (vol_in-vol_out)>500 group by distributer_id,(vol_in-vol_out),distributer_name,year order by year desc ;
Stage-Stage-2: Map: 1  Reduce: 1   Cumulative CPU: 2.01 sec   HDFS Read: 5009 HDFS Write: 0 SUCCESS

OK

no such distributer whose difference of volume_in-vol_out is greater than 500.


select distributer_id,distributer_name,year,(vol_in-vol_out) as diff from petrol group by distributer_id,(vol_in-vol_out),distributer_name,year order by diff desc ;
